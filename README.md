***Dragon Vs Hunter***
- 2 Dimensional PyGame implementation
- use 'up' or 'down' arrows to move the Dragon
- use the 'spacebar' to shoot fireballs
- you take damage when the hunters hit you or exceed the width of the screen
- the game progressively gets more difficult with each level
---
**Current Focus**
- Finishing the fullscreen -> windowed toggle implementation
- Fix the collision with fireballs and hunters, appears to be a rect issue
- get images without a background
- create a level background image
- implement an algorithm to randomize the hunter behavior further
- allow the user to navigate the x axis
---
**Secondary Focus**
- Gap Analysis
- Application Hardening
- Performance optimization
